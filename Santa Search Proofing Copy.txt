Santa Search
December 25, 12:00 AM

You wake up to the sound of something metal falling in the kitchen. You wait, but nothing happens.
You get out of bed, slowly, quietly, careful not to wake your parents.
[[You sneak out of your room and into the hallway. -> intro2]]
You step into the hallway and look down the hallway, both sides. All the lights are off. The door to your parents' room is slightly open.
[[Make sure they're asleep. -> intro3]]
You peek into your parents' room. They're sound asleep. They probably won't wake up for a while.
[[Investigate the kitchen. -> intro4]]
You go to the kitchen. You see the [[cookie tin you used the other day -> intro4a]] lying on the floor. It must have fallen on its own.

Suddenly, a thought crosses your mind. [[Has Santa visited yet? -> intro5]]
You and your parents made cookies for Santa together. It was amazing.

[[You hope he likes them. -> intro4]]
You rush into the living room, hurrying to check on the presents. On your way you notice a wet spot near the tree that wasn't there before. [[Maybe your dog had an accident? -> intro 5s]]
All your presents are there, but unfortunately, you don't see any new ones or anything from Santa.
But you've made up your mind.
You are going to [[catch Santa. -> lrhub]]
Wait, your dog hasn't had an accident in years, and anyway, the wet spot doesn't smell like anything. It's even cold to the touch. [[Almost like melted snow. -> intro5.1]]
